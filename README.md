# Movies Catalogue
Simple movies catalogue website made with MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, NodeJS). The website is deployed here -> [movie-catalogue](https://movies-mern-stack.web.app/). The app backend is deployed in heroku and uses the free tier, so you might experience delay of about 10 seconds if you start the app from heroku sleep state, don't get discouraged and wait for it to load, after the initial delay everything should run fine and pretty fast.

* Edit and delete their own movies
* Like and unlike movies from the catalogue
